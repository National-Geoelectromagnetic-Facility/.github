The NGF loans electromagnetic geophysics instruments to academic scientists, industry and government. It is not necessary to be an EM specialist to use NGF instruments. If you would like NGF staff to acquire and process and/interpret EM data for you, we can provide this service as well. The NGF is currently managing nearly 90 long-period, wideband and ultra wideband instruments.
